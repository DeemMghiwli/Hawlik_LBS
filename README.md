# Hwalik - Using location-based services


## Hello there!

Welcome to my graduation project, Haliwk, developed in the FlutterFlow environment (v4 - Flutter 3.13.7). This project is a collaborative effort with the invaluable contributions of my team members, Rima and Dai.

## Project Overview

Haliwk is a dynamic location-based application designed to showcase places in various categories such as hospitals, shopping centers, restaurants, and cafes, all tailored to match the user's profile.

## Team Collaboration

This project embodies the spirit of teamwork, highlighting the collaborative efforts that went into its development.

## Location-Based Recommendations

Haliwk utilizes advanced location-based services to provide personalized recommendations for places that align with the user's preferences, spanning hospitals, shopping destinations, restaurants, and cafes.

## Privacy Assurance

One unique feature of Haliwk is its commitment to user privacy. The app does not save any historical data, ensuring that your location and activity information remain secure and private.

## Important Note

Please be aware that as FlutterFlow is still in active development, the app's functionality may not always align with expectations, especially after version updates. For the purpose of this demonstration, we have utilized simulated data.

Thank you for exploring Haliwk! Feel free to provide feedback or contribute to our project. Enjoy the journey!
